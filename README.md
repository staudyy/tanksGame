# Tanks - A 2 Player Browser Game
A game where you control a tank and you try to navigate a maze and destroy your friend.
This is a browser game inspired by one of my favorite childhood games called *Tank Trouble*, but with lots of customizability. You can change the way the entire game behaves in virtually any way you want. I have always wanted to make the tanks shoot faster, or be able to shoot more bullets. So I remade the game and added all of these settings and many, many more!

## Settings
Negative values result in funny behavior, I could have disabled them, but I find them fun to play around with :) (Sometimes they break the game though.)

**Tank Acceleration** – How fast do the tanks accelerate. By default acceleration is higher than Tank Max Speed which means the tank accelerates to max speed instantly. Also this setting is a bit buggy and not completely finished yet and may sometimes cause weird behavior. (If you set the correct settings you can create a drifting tank!)

**Tank Max Speed** – How fast can the tanks move while fully accelerated.

**Tank Rotation Speed** – How fast can the tanks rotate (in degrees per step.)

**Maze Grid Size** – How big the maze in which you play is. Imagine the maze is a square grid. This setting determines the number of tiles in one row and column.

**Bullet Speed** – How fast do the bullets move.

**Tank Shot Delay** – How long do the tanks have to "reload." How long you have to wait before being able to fire another shot (in milliseconds.)

**Bullet Lifetime** – How long do the bullets exist before disappearing (in milliseconds.)

**Maximum Bullet Count** – How many bullets can one tank fire. After firing this amount the tank has to wait until some of the fired bullets reach the end of their lifetime and disappear.

**Shot Dispersion** – Firing inaccuracy. Randomness of the direction of fired bullets (in degrees.)

**Maze Emptiness** – A percentage. The higher the percentage, the more open and empty the maze is. This setting sets the chance for each wall in the maze to get deleted.

**Bullet Size** – How big the bullets are.

**Maze Thickness** – How thick the walls of the maze are.

**Tank Size** – How big the tanks are.
